<p>Willem's portfolio displays work in a simple 1 by 1 manner. It's clean and works well to categorize his work into each project he works on.</p>

<p>Lisa's portfolio showcases her work in groups rather than 1 by 1. What I like is that her work is consistent enough to make this format work and still look so clean.</p>
